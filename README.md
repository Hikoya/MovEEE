## MovEEE

In celebration of Singapore Polytechnic's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, We were tasked to develop a simple step counter application for the school-wide exercise for both Android and iOS platform.

The mobile application is downloaded and used during the celebration ceremony by both students of SEEE as well as staff as they take part in the dance program. By completing the number of movements, 60, which correspond with the Anniversary users were get a hidden button that leads to the page where they can collect their SEEE 60th Anniversary goodies
